# MM_index_validation

These are the scripts for the article by Velek, Splinter et all,
*Counting co-occurring diseases to predict mortality is as accurate as
multimorbidity indices: results from an external validation study in the
general population*

NB: The scripts rely on data that are not available in this repository.
We are unable to place data in a public repository due to legal and
ethical restraints. Sharing of individual participant data was not
included in the informed consent of the study, and there is potential
risk of revealing participantsâ€™ identities as it is not possible to
completely anonymise the data.

All questions regarding the scripts should be directed to Premysl Velek,
